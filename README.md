## Overview

This project involves building the homepage for an e-commerce site "Room" using React with Typescript. The primary goal is to:
- Replicate the designs as close as possible
- Implement an image slider 
- Change displayed content based on change in image
- Be able to use the mouse/trackpad or keyboard to navigate the slider
- Hover effects for all interactive elements on the page

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library for building user interfaces
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A build tool for modern JavaScript
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in several key areas:

1. Building React Applications:
  
I enhanced my skills in building React applications using JavaScript and improved significantly with TypeScript.

2. Working with Git Flow:

I learned how to effectively use the Git Flow approach for development, which helped me manage branches and streamline the development process.
Styling with Styled Components:

3. Instead of traditional CSS files, I utilized styled components for styling my React components, which offered a more modular and dynamic approach.

4. React Concepts:
I delved into the concepts of conditional rendering, useState, and useEffect.

5. Favorite Aspects:
I particularly enjoyed working with props in React and styled components, which allowed for flexible and reusable component designs.
Data-driven development in React was another aspect I found enjoyable and insightful.
Overall, this project was a fantastic learning experience that deepened my understanding of React and modern web development practices.

#### some code snippets:
```typescript
 const [isMenuClicked, setIsMenuClicked] = useState<boolean>(false)
```

### Continued development

Throughout the development there were a few parts that i fell short and would like to develop in those areas.
These areas are:
- the effective use of useState, useEffect, useRef and the other react hooks available
- Proper type handling
- Effective use of the git flow method of development
